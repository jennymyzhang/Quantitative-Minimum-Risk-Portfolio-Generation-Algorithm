It is a portfolio allocation algorithm that uses statistical analysis of stock data to generate a portfolio of minimal risk for risk-adverse clients.

During December 2020, It successfully achieved breakeven during a -10% market downturn.

I implemented market capitalization, beta, standard deviation and expected return analysis to evaluate the expected relative volatility of each stock.

Technologies used: Python, yfinance, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
